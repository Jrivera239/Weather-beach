# Weather App

## Description
The Weather App is a simple and intuitive web application that provides real-time weather information for cities around the globe. Users can easily search for their preferred locations and receive detailed weather data, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions. The app also features a search history functionality for quick access to previously searched cities.

3. Display: Updates the user interface with the current weather information.
4. History: Saves unique searches in a list for future access.
